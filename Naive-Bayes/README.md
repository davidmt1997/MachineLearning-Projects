# Naive-Bayes

Implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch in python wihtout using any fancy frameworks.

You can either enter a train and test file (.arff) or just a complete dataset (.arff), in this case it will randomly split it into 2 and use one for training and one for testing.

This implementation only works for categorical data.

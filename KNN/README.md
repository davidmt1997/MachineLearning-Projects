# KNN

Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm in python from scratch.

You can either enter a train and test file (.arff) or just a complete dataset (.arff), in this case it will randomly split it into 2 and use one for training and one for testing.

In addition, you have to enter how many k nearest neighbors you want to use.

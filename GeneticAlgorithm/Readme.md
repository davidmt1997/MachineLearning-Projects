## Genetic Algorithm

This project uses decimal representation of the chromosome for implementic a genetic algorithm.

The purpose of Genetic Algorithms is to learn to find the weights that maximize the equation on its own. 

- ga.py has the implementation of the algorithm

- example_ga.py is an example of how to use it
